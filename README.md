A simple task management framework.

Design goals
------------

Most the code is a stub at the moment. I'm working towards:

* A task management framework that is simple in design and functionality.
* A tool that acts as a reference implementation of this framework.
* Tasks to be serialized in a format that a typical user should be able to understand and manipulate.

Specifics are sketched out in the following blog posts:

* https://www.trevorparker.com/task-management-app-part-1/
* https://www.trevorparker.com/task-management-app-part-2/
* https://www.trevorparker.com/task-management-app-part-3/

Some details have changed (most are still quite fluid), such as the preferred serialization format (was JSON, now YAML).
